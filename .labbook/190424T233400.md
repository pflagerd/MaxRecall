### Redesign
I want MaxRecall to present both the question and the answer on a single (wide) card.

I want to move between the question and the answer by buttons and by swiping.

I want there to be four fixed areas in each of the four corners, just as there are now.

I want to work on questions and answers with an editor like Typora.

I want the same questions and answers to be reusable as or within stand-alone web pages.

All graphic elements must size relative to the window size.
